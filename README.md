# ProjectMMM
The project is parted into 3 stages. First was to make theoretic assumptions and skeleton for future program. Second was to make previous work correctly fixing bugs and understanding mistakes. Branches Project_buckets_ver1 and Project_buckets_ver2 are meant to explain what was done is those stages (especially the read.me files inside). Short explenation in polish here:

In third stage we will make working GUI to show our results in real time.
